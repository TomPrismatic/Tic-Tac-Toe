Summitive 1

This is a programme of Tic Tac Toe with three playable modes.

To play the game type either E, H or P into the console and play from there.

To place a o or x type two numbers without a space between e.g 02

The board looks like this

| 00   01   02|
| 10   11   12|
| 20   21   22|


First summative, Thomas Sheppard 

 During this summative, I believe I made great progress in my understanding of how MinMax algorithms
 work and how they can be applied to problems such as that of Tic Tac Toe. I believe that I wrote my
 code in a smart and concise way and with my consistent naming convention and commenting it should
 be easy for others to understand and read. In the future I need to focus on both algorithms equally
 as my understanding of Alpha Beta Pruning originally was a little less than that of minmax.
 However when I actually got too it in code it was very simple to implement and after I made a few
 checks I found that after pruning my code made about a third of the checks it previously did.
 Another area I could work on is my planning and pseudocode, so that in the early stages I have
 a clear idea of where I'm heading.
